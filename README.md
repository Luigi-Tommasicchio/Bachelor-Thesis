# Bachelor Thesis

This is going to be a brief description of my bachelor thesis in Economics and Management. Since I'm passionate about finance, data, and coding, I decided to develop a thesis that could include these things. 
That's why I went for some sort of guide and empirical experiment thesis about time-series analysis and forecasting applied to the stock market. Now of course I wasn't expecting to actually manage to predict 
the future price of a stock so I could get rich, but I totally enjoyed the learning journey. When I decided to go for this thesis research question I didn't know anything about time series or foresting.
So in the beginning, I spent several hours if not days and weeks trying to get a reasonable understanding of the subject. I used YouTube videos, websites, books, etc... Later I started writing down my thesis and 
coding in Python to put my knowledge into practice. After several challenges, this is what the final work looks like. I really hope you like it and can learn something from it. If you have any questions or any suggestions to further
improve the work please contact me, I'd be really happy to answer.
